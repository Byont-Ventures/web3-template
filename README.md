# Smart contract

## 1. Install packages

```
npm install --global yarn@1.22.19
```

Then in the root of this repo:

````
yarn install

## 2. Install foundry

See the [docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html).

## 3. Smart contract style guide

For solidity smart code, solidity.org has published its [standard](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/style-guide.html) which is similar to pythonâ€™s [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds).

Also, the project has configured automatic formatter for [visual code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which enables the auto-format in `.vscode/settings.json`.

Solhint is enabled with plugin [prettier](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity) to alert possible coding style mistake.

To configure/exclude certain rules reported by solhint, `.solhint.json` should be edited. for more details please refer solhint config documentation [here](https://github.com/protofire/solhint/blob/master/docs/rules.md#best-practise-rules).

### A few highlights

#### Error messages for `requires()`

```solidity
require(<statement>, "<contract name> (<function name>): <error message>");
````

#### Implementing an interface

When a contract implements an interface add the interface which you are implementing above the set of function.

Additionally, all functions in an interface should have [natspec](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/natspec-format.html) comments. When implementing the function from the interface make sure to inherit the comments.

```solidity
interface IMyInterface {
  /// @notice Does the important thing
  /// @dev Should only be called on Tuesdays
  /// @param value The value to process
  function a(uint256 value) external;
}

contract MyContract is IMyInterface, IOtherInterface {
  //--------------------------------------------------
  // IMyInterface
  //--------------------------------------------------

  /// @inheritdoc IMyInterface
  function a(uint256 value) external override {
    uint256 b = value * 2;
  }

  //--------------------------------------------------
  // IOtherInterface
  //--------------------------------------------------
  ...
}
```

#### Development

Changing the used solc version can be done in [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml).

#### Add a smart contract to the project

A new smart contract can be created in this project by simply making a new file in the `/src/smart-contracts` and `/test/smart-contracts` folder. Scripts can be placed in scripts/smart-contracts/

# Frontend

[![Production](https://github.com/DUCATA-private/DUCATA.io/actions/workflows/production.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/DUCATA-private/DUCATA.io/actions/workflows/production.yml)

The Ducata website repository holds all the source code for the website. This repository is largely based on the [Shopify Polaris (`polaris-react`)](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/tree/main/polaris-react).

## Installation

**Prerequisites**: `yarn > 1.22.x`, and `node > 16.x.x`.

```sh
cp .env.example .env.local

yarn install

# Generate boilerplate code for gRPC
yarn buf:generate
```

## Development

Before getting started we suggest reading our [Contributing Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Running locally

```sh
# Run the entire website locally
yarn dev
```

### Running a server

We've included a small webserver that implements the gRPC services for local testing. See the [server documentation](/.server/README.md) for more information.

### Testing

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test all components of our application. You can test these components using `yarn test`. Alternatively you can run Jest in watch mode using `yarn test:watch`. Watch mode also enables to specify the name or path to a file to focus on a specific set of tests.

```sh
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run all tests and watch for changes
yarn test:watch
```
